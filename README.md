# wax_iiif

This fork is TRULY just a copy of the [iiif_s3 gem](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3) with all the s3 dependencies and functionality removed!

It enables the static creation of IIIF derivatives (level 0) for static exhibtion sites with [wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).

For credit and documentation, head over to [iiif_s3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3).
