[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mnyrop/wax_iiif.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mnyrop/wax_iiif) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/3eb2fcf5ae47e7b6d686/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/mnyrop/wax_iiif/maintainability)

This fork is TRULY just a copy of the [iiif_s3 gem](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3) with all the s3 dependencies and functionality removed!

It enables the static creation of IIIF derivatives (level 0) for static exhibtion sites with [wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).

For credit and documentation, head over to [iiif_s3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3).
